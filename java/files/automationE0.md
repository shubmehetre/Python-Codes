# Module 1 - Test Automation

- Automatic simulating all the functionalities of our webserver.

## Benifits

- Speed
- reliable
- Coverage
- Repeatability
- Reusable
- consistent to compliance
- Better quality
- improve time to market

## what and when to use this

- For stable apps
- For frequently executed tests
- functionalities with deterministic results
- Tests involving multiple data entries

## Myths

- Automation replacing manual testers
- immidiately effective
- find more bugs than manual
- one tool to rule them all
- 100% test Coverage
- Confirm ROI

## Key factors

- know ur budget
- need skilled resources
- need complete manual test cases
- need test data
- have a realistic expectation

# Module 2 -

* Proceses

## Req gathering
	- Analyzr req
	- Understand
	- Document

## Initiation

1. Feasibility evaluation:  Todo automation or not
	- technical
	- tool

2. Tool Evalution
	- Analysis of tool
	- availability of resources
	- cost
	- all needs satisfies ?
	- suitable for our env and technology?
	- does is support all objects in the project

3. POC
	- Identify and automate a sample test cases
	- cost to implement tool

4. Strategy
	- what and how
	- how to maintain scripts
	- expected costs and time benifits

5. Planning
	- Scope
	- Framework
	- Schedule
	- Cost
	- documentation
	- to accomplish:
		- automation activities
		- resource plan
		- training
		- deleverables to be produced

6. Design:
	- test cases are studies and selected
	- identification of necessary utilities

7. Build Phase:
	- Convert all plan and design to create scripts
	- create initial building block of automation framework
	- this will create library of common reusable scripts
	- proper standards need to be in place
	- this can depend on scripting language

8. Execution:
	- execution of test cases/scripts using automation tool
	- analyze the results
	- execution can be scheduled

9. Maintenance:
	- Enhance existing scripts to make them more maintain

## Roles

- Test Automation Lead:
	- Req gathering and analysis
	- Initiate
	- Plan
- Automation Architect:
	- Design
- Test Automation Engineers:
	- Build
	- Execute
	- Maintain

-----------------

# Module 3 - Automation Framework

## Requirments:
	- easy to maintain framework
	- technical expertise to develop the Framework
	- req right privileges

## Why:
	- Set of guidelines
	- organized framework help avoid duplication of tests cases
	- help team organize team's test suite

## Types
	- Linear: Basic
	- Modular: scripts divided in form of modules
	- Data driven: data stored in external files and called by scripts
	- Keyword driven: Set keywords for certain actions
	- Hybrid: Combinig any framework

# Module 4 - Test Automation Metrics

## Categories

- Coverage
- Progress
- Quality: usabality, performing, defect reporting

## Why

- to drive improvements and help businesses focus their ppl and resources on what is important
- indicate priorities
- TELL:
	- where it has been
	- where it is heading
	- is something going wrong
	- when will the org reach its goals

## Benifits

- Drive the strategy and direction of an org
- drive the performance
- provide focus
- help make better decisions
- change and evolve
- establish good relations

## METRICS

> Mesure performance (past present future) of implemented tests
> Shud have proper goal

## Characteristics

- Objective
- Measurable
- help identify areas for improvements
- simple
- meaningful

## KPI - key performance indicator

- Scale
- Efficiency
- Return on Spend

## TCS Automation metrics
